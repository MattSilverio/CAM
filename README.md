# Machine Learning Course (FGA0083)
Release: mar/2025

Welcome to the Machine Learning Course repository for the 2024/1 semester, taught by Dr. Sergio Antônio Andrade de Freitas. This repository serves as a central hub for course materials, projects, and assignments related to FGA0083 at the University of Brasília.

## Course Overview

This course aims to equip students with a solid understanding and practical skills in machine learning, focusing on pattern recognition through regression, classification, unsupervised learning techniques, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. By integrating theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience, the course prepares students to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand machine learning concepts and techniques
- Apply machine learning techniques to practical problems
- Evaluate and adapt machine learning algorithms to various contexts

## Course Methodology

The course adopts a Project-Based Learning (PBL) approach, encouraging students to work in groups on projects that apply machine learning concepts. Individual quizzes and mini-projects supplement learning, reinforcing concepts through practical application. The use of Scrum methodology is recommended for project management.

## Evaluation Criteria

Student performance is assessed through a combination of individual quizzes, team-based mini-projects, and a semester-long project. Participation, collaboration, and practical application of machine learning techniques are key components of the evaluation.

## Requirements

For this course, you will need the following Python libraries:

- **scikit-learn**: A versatile library providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis; ideal for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **tensorflow**: An open-source platform for machine learning, offering comprehensive tools and libraries to enable deep learning and neural network development.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **pandas**: Essential for data manipulation and analysis, offering data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
- **numpy**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, supporting large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- **Pyarrow**: A cross-language development platform for in-memory data, facilitating high-performance data exchange and storage solutions.
